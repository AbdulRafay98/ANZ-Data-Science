# ANZ-Data-Science

Data Science is a contact sport at ANZ - it’s about mining and linking datasets to develop stories that matter and challenge the status quo.
We are looking to distill unique insights from the data that will enable us to take action. We want to know “what does all this data actually mean for us and our clients, and what should we do next?”

## EDA
Analyse transaction dataset with an analysis tool (Tableau)
Done some basic checks – are there any data issues? Does the data need to be cleaned?
Gathered some interesting overall insights about the data.
Segmented the dataset by transaction date and time. Visualised transaction volume and spending over the course of an average day or week.

## Predictive Analysis
Used statistical software, Python. Using the same transaction dataset, identified the annual salary for each customer.
Explored correlations between annual salary and various customer attributes (e.g. age). Visualised interesting correlations using a scatter plot.
Build a simple regression model to predict the annual salary for each customer using the attributes identified in above step.
